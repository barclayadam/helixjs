[![HelixJS](http://www.helixjs.org/images/logo-small.png)](http://www.helixjs.org)

**HelixJS** provides a solid foundation for creating rich web applications, built 
on the [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library.

HelixJS aims to provide the required structure and features required to build great
and well structured Single Page Application, building on top of 2 well known tools so
as to not throw away any of your existing code or time investment:

 * Knockout
 * Browserify

Helix provides a number of key components that are not provided by Knockout for
creating killer applications:

 * A routing engine
 * Validation
 * A number of UI components built to work from mobile to desktop

All of these features build on knockout in a natural way that does not impose too
much structure. We want you to feel like you are writing pretty plain javascript and
knockout code, not HelixJS.

##Supported Browsers

 * IE8+
 * Chrome (Latest)
 * Firefox (Latest)

Other browsers that match the feature sets of Chrome and Firefox are likely to
work as well as the other browsers, they are just not yet fully tested and
supported.

##Building HelixJs from source

If you prefer to build the library yourself:

 1. **Clone the repo from GitHub**

        git clone https://github.com/barclayadam/helixjs.git
        cd helixjs

 2. **Acquire build dependencies.** 

   Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your workstation. This is only needed to _build_ Helix from sources. Helix itself has no dependency on Node.js once it is built (it works with any server technology or none). 

   HelixJS uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system, and [Browserify](http://browserify.org) for module management.

    Now run:

        npm install -g gulpjs
        npm install -g browserify
        npm install

    You might need to run these command with `sudo` if you're on Linux or Mac OS X, or in an Administrator command prompt on Windows.

 3. **Run the build tool**

        gulp
