## Why HelixJS?

You love the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. You love [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.org) but want to develop in a more structured way to build scalable, maintainable single-page Web apps.

Using [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.org) as a foundation, **HelixJS** offers an opinionated framework for building Web apps. Features include:

- Application semantics - extensions to Knockout binding handlers allows  Web app composition using injectable regions
- Routing engine
- ViewModel lifecycle events
- Application modules, IoC container and dependency injection
- Extensible form validation framework
- Templating engine extensions

## Live Example

{% highlight javascript %}
function Whatever() {
  // do something
}
{% endhighlight %}
