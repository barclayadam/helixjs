    # When this view model is shown, executed
    # every time the view model is to be shown to the
    # user after having been disposed / deactivated / hidden.
    #
    # Any promises returned from this method will have to be
    # executed before the view this view model represents is
    # actually shown to the user, to avoid the flash of
    # content being shown, followed by further loading screens to
    # load data required by this view model.
    beforeShow: (parameters) ->

    # Once this view model has been shown this method is called,
    # to allow further work to be performed that does not
    # need to be done before actually showing this view to the user.
    #
    # This method will be called once all work of the beforeShow method
    # has been completed and the view has been bound to the view model.
    show: (parameters) ->

    # Called when the view this view model is bound to is being hidden from
    # the user, used to dispose of resources this view model may be holding
    # on to which are no longer required.
    #
    # Note that a hidden view may be shown once again in the future, starting
    # the lifecycle from the `beforeShow` method.
    hide: ->

    # Called when this view model should be completely destroyed, such
    # that it will never be shown again to the user (a different view model
    # instance will need to be recreated to use the view model again).

 We want to register in to the sitemap. This puts a /Users/View element
 that will, when clicked, navigate to the 'View User' route. Sitemap
 would listen for routeNavigated events for determining current
 route being shown for breadcrumb purposes.

$sitemap
    .register '/Users/View', 'View User'
    .register '/Users/Edit', 'Edit User'
