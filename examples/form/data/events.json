	"MaterialCovered": "<h4>Visual Studio SharePoint Tools - Project/Feature/Package properties, New Deployment Options, SPApp Packaging</h4><p>Visual Studio 2012 includes new Item Templates for developing against SharePoint 2013, including SharePoint Applications (SPApps). This module explores the new tooling and overall enhancements to the developer IDE.</p><h4>SharePoint Applications (SPApps) - SharePoint-Hosted</h4><h4>SharePoint Applications (SPApps) - Azure-Hosted Auto-provisioned (Client Web Part)</h4><h4>Developer-Hosted (Chrome Control, OAuth)</h4><p>SharePoint 2013 introduces both a corporate and a public Marketplace (App Catalog). Finally! In short, you can now write applications for SharePoint (SPApps) that extend SharePoint sites using the new SharePoint App Model. This module covers everything you will need to know about the three models for developing SharePoint Apps and potentially monetizing your SPApp by deploying it to the Marketplace.</p><h4>Client-side Object Model (CSOM) - Managed-code contexts; greatly expanded, far more than SharePoint Lists</h4><h4>JavaScript Object Model (JSOM) - JavaScript contexts (cross domain)</h4><h4>SharePoint REST - Greatly expanded, far more than SharePoint Lists</h4><p>SharePoint 2013 is all about hosting external application functionality in a SharePoint context. Those external applications (SPApps) will often need to interact with the SharePoint environment. This module illustrates how to leverage each of the various client object models implementations in SharePoint projects to access SharePoint data from the app server.</p><h4>Remote Event Receivers</h4><p>Traditionally, event receivers ran imperative logic on the SharePoint server. SharePoint 2013 adds remote event receivers to handle events that occur on a list item, a list, or a web in a SPApp. Additionally, SPApp event receivers handle events involving the app itself, such as when it's installed or deleted.</p><h4>Business Connectivity Services - ECT/External List via OData</h4><h4>Business Connectivity Services - External List Event Receivers, Alerts, and CRUD</h4><p>Information is frequently not confined entirely to SharePoint databases. This module focuses on consuming and interacting with external data sources using a custom .NET Assembly Connector. Creating BCS-enabled SharePoint Apps, the new remote callouts, the extended client-side object model are explored as well.</p><h4>Workflow New Windows Azure Workflow (AppFabric Workflow model, remote Web Services, dynamic values, stages, etc.)</h4><p>In SharePoint 2013, Windows Azure Workflow (WAW) Services isolates logic into a service that is independent of SharePoint. This module demonstrates how to create custom workflows using either SharePoint Designer 2013 or Visual Studio 2012.</p><h4>Search - Redesigned, incorporates FAST capabilities</h4><p>SharePoint 2013 unifies FAST search capabilities into a single powerful API that even the built-in List View Web Part uses to retrieve information from the SharePoint Content Database. In fact, search can be configured to be aware of everything that is happening within SharePoint. In a way, SharePoint Search is a super performant, all-knowing SharePoint developer's friend. This module illustrates how to simultaneously retrieve information from multiple contexts in sub-seconds using SharePoint Search.</p><h4>Design Manager - Bring your own web design tool</h4><p>SharePoint 2013 includes a new browser-based Design Manager in the top-level Site in any Publishing Site Collection for managing all aspects of branding a SharePoint site. This module boosts your existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript expertise to design custom Master Pages and Page Layouts that reflect your brand in SharePoint using any HTML editor.</p><h4>Windows 8 Metro style app - Interacts with SharePoint</h4><p>Metro style apps are the focal point of the user experience on Windows 8 Release Preview, and great Metro style apps share an important set of traits that provide a consistent, elegant, and compelling user experience.</p><h4>Word/Excel/Outlook Agave - Host external functionality within an Office application</h4><p>Replacing Office Add-ins, Agave's allow the developer to create an Office App that hosts external functionality as a Task Pane or Content Agave. This module facilitates an interface between an external application that can consume and manipulate the content within the Office application.</p>",
